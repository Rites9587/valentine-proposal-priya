        From our first conversation on <b>17 September</b>,  
        something felt easy… natural… real.
    </p>

    <p>
        You loving food 🍕🍰 makes me smile,  
        because the best conversations always happen  
        around good food and honest laughs.
    </p>

    <p>
        And the fact that we share the same birthday —  
        <b>12th April</b> —  
        feels like the universe quietly saying,<br>
        “You two were meant to cross paths.”

    <h2>So… will you be my Valentine? ❤️</h2>
